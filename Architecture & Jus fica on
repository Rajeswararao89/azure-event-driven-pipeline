 This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview and design justification for an event-driven
 data processing pipeline built on Microsoft Azure. The solution leverages serverless computing, event routing,
 and automated infrastructure management to enable continuous data ingestion, transformation, and daily
 report generation. By adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD practices, the system ensures agility,
 scalability, and operational consistency across deployments.
 1. High-Level Architecture Overview
 The architecture is based on an event-driven and serverless design using core Azure components. Data files
 are uploaded by users or systems into a dedicated Azure Blob Storage “raw” container. Upon upload, Azure
 Event Grid automatically triggers an Ingest Function App that processes and transforms the data, saving
 cleaned output into a “processed” container. A separate Report Function App runs daily (using a Timer
 Trigger) to aggregate processed data and generate daily summary reports stored in a “reports” container.
 Infrastructure provisioning is automated through Terraform, while GitHub Actions ensures continuous
 integration and deployment of both infrastructure and code updates.
 2. Design Justification
 The decision to use Azure’s serverless ecosystem is grounded in scalability, cost efficiency, and
 maintainability. Azure Blob Storage was chosen as the central storage system because of its high durability
 and integration with Event Grid. Event Grid enables near real-time notifications without the need for constant
 polling. Azure Functions eliminate the need for server provisioning and scale automatically according to
 workload. Timer Triggers provide reliable scheduling for recurring jobs, making them ideal for daily reporting
 tasks. Terraform ensures reproducibility and infrastructure consistency across environments, while GitHub
 Actions automates deployment pipelines to reduce manual errors.
 3. Automation & Deployment Flow
 The system’s automation pipeline is designed to handle code and infrastructure updates seamlessly.
 Developers push changes to a GitHub repository that includes both Terraform definitions and Azure Function
 code. A GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically, authenticating with Azure using a Service Principal and
 executing Terraform commands (“init”, “plan”, and “apply”) to provision or update resources. Function Apps
 are packaged, validated, and deployed using the same CI/CD process. This approach provides a zero-touch
 deployment mechanism where all updates pass through version control and automated validation steps
 before production rollout.
 4. Reporting Process
 The reporting layer of this architecture automates the generation of daily data summaries. The Report
 Function App, triggered via a Timer Trigger, connects to the processed container, lists all available data files,
 extracts metadata such as filename, size, and timestamp, and aggregates these into a structured CSV report.
 The report is then uploaded to the “reports” container within Blob Storage. Optional extensions include
 integrating Azure Logic Apps or SendGrid to email the generated reports automatically to stakeholders,
 ensuring timely insights without human intervention.
5. Fault Tolerance & Scalability
 The entire system is designed with scalability and reliability as core principles. Azure Blob Storage
 guarantees high availability and data durability with multiple redundancies. Event Grid offers built-in retry
 mechanisms and supports dead-letter queues for event recovery. Azure Functions scale dynamically with
 demand, allowing the system to process high volumes of events efficiently. To enhance performance,
 processed data can be partitioned by date or category, and report generation can be optimized using parallel
 executions. Monitoring and logging are handled by Azure Application Insights, which provides metrics, traces,
 and alerting for operational visibility.
 6. Security Considerations
 Security in this architecture follows Azure’s best practices and the principle of least privilege. Function Apps
 use Managed Identities to authenticate securely to Blob Storage without embedded credentials. Access
 Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) are applied to restrict access to storage and
 compute resources. Sensitive information such as API keys or connection strings are stored in Azure Key
 Vault, ensuring encryption at rest and in transit. Additionally, all activity is logged through Azure Monitor and
 Azure Activity Logs, supporting compliance and audit requirements.
 7. Conclusion
 The Azure-based event-driven data pipeline described here achieves full automation, resilience, and
 scalability while minimizing operational overhead. By leveraging serverless components, event-driven
 triggers, and IaC-driven deployment, it fulfills the assignment’s objectives of automated data processing, daily
 reporting, and DevOps integration. This solution demonstrates industry-standard architectural practices
 suitable for modern cloud engineering environments
